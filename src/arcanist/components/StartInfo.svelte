    These are combos for intended for 332 (3 Stack skills, 3 Ruin skills, 2
    Normal skills) Empress Arcanist.
  </h3>
  <br />

  <h3>General Stacking</h3>
  <div>
    Use Scratch Dealer + Quadra Accelerate or Spiral Edge twice (chain skill) to
    gain 4 stacks. A tripod in Scratch Dealer provides attack speed to help land
    all Quadra Accelerate hits so it is used first.
  </div>
  <br />

  <h3>Ruin Skill Priority</h3>
  <div>
    Although Secret Garden has the highest Damage Per Cooldown (DPC), it is
    difficult to manage optimal rotations off cooldowns. Celestial Rain is
    realistically better as its longer range makes it easier to land.
    Serendipity is inefficient to use in most cases due to its long cooldown but
    can be used when either Secret Garden or Celestial Rain are halfway or more
    through their cooldowns.
  </div>
  <br />

  <h3>Basic Rotation Pattern</h3>
  <div>
    The bread-and-butter combo is 4 stacks → Return → Ruin skill → 4 stacks →
    Ruin skill. The two Ruin skills should be used during the duration of
    Return's buff.
